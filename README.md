In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, many working professionals struggle to maintain a healthy diet. Long work
hours, high-stress environments, frequent travel, and lack of time often lead to reliance on fast food,
takeout, or ultra-processed meals. Additionally, many of these individuals have limited cooking skills
or confidence in the kitchen, further discouraging them from preparing nutritious meals at home.
